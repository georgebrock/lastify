# Lastify

A SIMBL plugin that adds Last.fm Love and Ban capabilities to Spotify.
It works enough to be useable, but it's a long way from perfect.

### Done

* Working SIMBL plugin
* Simple GUI
* Authentication with Last.fm
* "Love track" Last.fm API call
* "Ban track" Last.fm API call
* Tracking of what's currently playing in Spotify
* Store authentication tokens in keychain

### Still to do

* Better error handling when talking to Last.fm
