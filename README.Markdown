# Lastify

A SIMBL plugin that adds Last.fm Love and Ban capabilities to Spotify.

### Done

* Working SIMBL plugin
* Simple GUI
* Authentication with Last.fm
* "Love track" Last.fm API call
* "Ban track" Last.fm API call

### Still to do

* Store authentication tokens in keychain (user currently has to authorise every time they run Spotify)
* Tracking of what's currently playing in Spotify (can reuse code form SpotifyScrobbler)
* Better error handling when talking to Last.fm
