      <h2>A few notes…</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lastify is open source: all of
          <a href='https://github.com/georgebrock/lastify'>the code is on GitHub</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spotify doesn't ofﬁcially support plugins. Lastify, and all other
          SIMBL or Input Manager based plugins, are slightly dangerous (they
          may cause Spotify to crash).
        </li>
        <li>
          When a new version of Spotify comes out Lastify will stop working
          and you will need to download a new version. It may take a while
          to produce a new version of Lastify depending on what's changed in
          Spotify.
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't know (or really want to know) enough about Windows to make
          a Windows version, sorry.
        </li>
